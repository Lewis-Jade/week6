# Assignment Summary

## Task 1: Edge AI Prototype
- Lightweight image classification model for recyclable items.
- Tools: TensorFlow Lite, Google Colab.
- Model converted to TFLite for edge deployment.
- Benefits: real-time processing, low latency, privacy-preserving.

## Task 2: Smart Agriculture System
- Sensors: soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light, pH, EC, leaf wetness, NDVI camera.
- AI Model: Multi-input deep learning combining LSTM (time-series), CNN (images), dense layers (metadata).
- Data Flow: Sensors → Edge → Cloud → Model Deployment → Farmers/Dashboard.
- Benefits: Optimize water/fertilizer use, early stress detection, yield prediction.

## Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine
- Dataset: Cancer Genomic Atlas.
- Identified biases: underrepresentation of ethnic groups, sampling and algorithmic biases.
- Fairness strategies: diverse data, bias auditing, transparent models, cross-institution collaboration, ethical oversight.

## Task 4: Futuristic AI Proposal 2030
- Concept: Neural interface for cognitive health monitoring and enhancement.
- Problem: Early detection of neurodegenerative diseases is difficult; limited personalized interventions.
- AI Workflow: EEG + lifestyle + environmental data → Hybrid deep learning → Predictive risk scores and recommendations.
- Risks/Benefits: Early intervention, healthcare cost reduction, privacy concerns, bias, ethical issues.

## Bonus Task: Quantum Computing Simulation
- Used IBM Quantum Experience to simulate a simple quantum circuit.
- Potential: Speed up AI optimization tasks, e.g., faster drug discovery.
